# RuralView

# Problem statement (Issue we are solving):
The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted every aspect of life and two aspects inparticular are feeling the brunt of the event. The economy is struggling withoverwhelming unemployment rates and businesses are finding it difficult to keepafloat. With lockdown rules in place, people are feeling more disconnected fromothers than ever.”In this hackathon, your challenge is to create a product that addresses either

● An economic issue caused by COVID-19○E.g. streamlining business processes for distribution in lockdown,transitioning to remote working, transitioning from a brick-mortar storeto an online business

● A community-related issue caused by COVID-19○E.g. disconnection in aged care, language barriers and the exclusion ofminority groups, connecting to family or friends from the safety ofhome, decreased community involvement in local suburbs.


# Solution

Create an IOS and an Android application which presents to the user the location of businesses that sell a specific selected item. This reassures to the customer that they can find these items
within there local community and thus won't have to go to another supermarkt (usually a big market) which is located in another community and is thus far away and/or they can find alternative markets which is closer to them then the previous markets they'd need to go for select items. Our actual application will generate a map once the customer has searched for and clicked the necessary product they need to buy. This map will have arrows/pointers to the location of the appropriate business's which sell that item within the selected search radius they want. 

# Features (to be fully implemented)...

1. For each business which pops up on the map, there arrow will be colour coded. Each colour will represent the stock availability for that specific product, it also takes into consideration the rate at which the product is bought. This is to ensure that customers aren't misled by these colours as they can change, thus by the time they've already arrived to the shop then stock availability level maybe critical. 

2. There will be a measurement on how many people occupy the shop per 5 metres, so they are aware of how crowded that shopping centre/business is.

3. The biggest extension would be to create the most effecient route to go shopping for a selected set of items within a certain radius. This route can have multiple stops, each stop will indicate what items they can buy at that business. 

4. As an extension of number 3 and 1, there will be a car delivery service system using the route and stock availability system. It'll be somewhat similar to a normal uber-eats system however this system will be optimised in a way that there will be multiple items being picked up from various locations and then delivered to the user. 

# Relevance to COVID-19

1. It demonstrated to us how closely linked and how much we come into contact with each other as shown by the exponential spread of disease, thus further accentuating the risk posed by having a community which has a lot of contact with each other to people with compromised immune systems such as he elderly and people who have a history of chronic diseases, cancer and aids. It would also be recommended that people who come into contact with such people on a daily basis such as nurses, pre-school teachers and disability carers, try to limit the contact they have the community in some aspects as to avoid the spread of disease onto those who are most vulnerable. 
Our application's extension of allowing people to see the what products are nearby and what products are available to them will help them make less trips for a range of items as they'll be certain that they are going to a shop with that item rather then mindlessly making trips to small businesses which don't have an online platform they can use to show what items they're selling. Along with this, the first extension of showing stock availability to people shoppping, prevents them from making unnecessary trips to shops that are out of stock and the 2nd extension helps people with compromised immune systems to make informed decisions as to where they should go if they need to worry about the spread of diseases such as the cold, flu, coronavirus and many more others.

Ultimately, our long term goal is to create a delivery system that instructs drivers to pick up various items from various different local businesses and generate a route to follow that allows them to deliver in an effecient manner. This would ultimately help many people of compromised immune systems and many people who have a busy schedule that live in more densely populated regions too. 

However, our short term goal is just to notify the customers of a specific selected item which is in various local businesses but also within a selected/personalised radius from where they are. 

2. Covid-19 has also demonstrated to us that cases of community transmission of diseases are also very possible, and one of the ways this can happen is also going to large supermarkets in other densely populated areas and bringing back a contagious virus from that area into your town. This app, directly tries to mitigate that in its first stage of development by showing the user that there are options they can go for within their local community which they may not know about. This not only helps reduce the probability of community transmission but it can also serve as an app that can make contact tracing a little bit more easier for the government too, which would be of usefulness during any pandemic. 

3. This product really helps a lot of small businesses who may be technologically challanged or may be in a financial situation where they are unable to create an online platform for them. However, this product does that for them, for every product there is a list of businesses which sell this product, essentially they are getting free advertising and even during tough times like the pandemic, by shifting the customers focus onto local businesses it can provide them with sufficient sales such that they can stay afloat during those tough times, all because there is an online platform which links customers to these local businesses. Thus in short, you'd effectively be contributing to the creation of a stronger local economy by supporting local businesses. 

# List Products 

First i will be listing essential select items. 
Next we will try to broaden the range of items by including other grocery items. 
As we develop the app more and more, we'll try to add as many items as possible or as needed when talking about doing errands such as shopping. 

# Constraints

One of the constraints would be, if business's are willing to cooperate with us as we need there data. However at the same time, we may be giving them some sort of online platform they've never had so this would give them some incentive to actually be on this app. Ultimately, with government funding and financial support there would be an effective rollout in the especially rural communities. Another, constraint would be to get permission to have data such as stock availability rates and customer level rates however if the rollout of the application proves to be strong it will be easier to move on to the next stages of the application. 

This app will be released on an IOS and an ANDROID app. However, as we get into the further stages we may make a Website for this application in order to maximise our reach to people who particularly would need / benefit of it.
